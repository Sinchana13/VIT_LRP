# VIT_LRP
This project implements a classification model for fetal ultrasound images using a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT). The goal is to classify fetal images into different anatomical planes, such as the fetal brain, thorax, abdomen, and femur, by leveraging the powerful feature extraction capabilities of ViT.
